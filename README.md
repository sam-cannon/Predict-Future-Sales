# Time-Series-Exploration
This is a time series forecasting project that I started with a dataset from Kaggle. I was exploring seasonal trends in the
data to see if I could pick up on themes throughout the years that this data covered. From there, I created new features
based on holidays, weekends, item pricing dynamics, and whether items were returned or not. If anyone has any questions
about my code please do not hesitate to email me at fultoncannon@gmail.com
